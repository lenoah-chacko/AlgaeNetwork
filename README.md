# Angular Project

This is a web app made in connection to a project submitted for the Global Social Leaders Festival, Australia. This is my first Angular app and uses basic bootstrap styles.
It has basic login, register components, a UI for viewing submissions and a UI to make submissions.
This is a MEAN stack application and was made with Node.js, Express.js, Angular 9 and MongoDB.
It is hosted on Firebase while the backend is hosted on Heroku.
